# 198. House Robber

## Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

### Solution
```javascript
/**
 * Solved with Dynamic Programming (DP)
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var rob = function(nums) {
    "use strict";
    if (nums.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (nums.length === 1) {
        return nums[0];
    }
    let dp = [nums[0], Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])];
    for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let tmp = dp[1];
        dp[1] = Math.max(nums[i]+dp[0], dp[1]);
        dp[0] = tmp;
    }
    return Math.max(dp[0], dp[1]);
};
```
