# 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence
 
## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,3,5,4,7]
<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [2,2,2,2,2]
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
</pre>

**Note:** Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

### Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findLengthOfLCIS = function(nums) {
    "use strict";
    let max = 0;
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (i === 0 || nums[i] > nums[i-1]) {
            count++;
        } else {
            max = count > max ? count : max;
            count = 1;
        }
    }
    max = count > max ? count : max;
    return max;
};
```
