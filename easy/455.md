# 455. Assign Cookies

## Description

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor g<sub>i</sub>, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If s<sub>j</sub> >= g<sub>i</sub>, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Note:**
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3], [1,1]<br>
<b>Output:</b> 1<br>
<b>Explanation:</b> You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,2], [1,2,3]<br>
<b>Output:</b> 2<br>
<b>Explanation:</b> You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

### Solution
```javascript
/**
 * Solved with two pointers
 * @param {number[]} g
 * @param {number[]} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var findContentChildren = function(g, s) {
    "use strict";
    g.sort((a,b) => a-b);
    s.sort((a,b) => a-b);
    let assignChild = 0;
    for (let i = g.length-1, j = s.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (g[i] <= s[j]) {
            assignChild++;
            j--;
        }
        if (assignChild === g.length) {
            return assignChild;
        }
    }
    return assignChild;
};
```
