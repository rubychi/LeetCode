# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Description

Say you have an array for which the *i*<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
### Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    "use strict";
    let profit = 0
    let min = prices[0], max = prices[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] < min) {
			// Current profit is greater than the previous one
            if (max-min > profit) {
                profit = max-min;
            }
            min = prices[i];
			// Find the max number greater than current index
            max = prices[i];
        }
        if (max < prices[i]) {
            max = prices[i];
        }
    }
	// Final profit is greater than the previous one
    if (max-min > profit) {
        profit = max-min;
    }
    return profit;
};
```
